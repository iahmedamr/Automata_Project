It was a quiet morning in New York. John Miller was sipping his coffee when 
he received an unexpected email from sara.brown24@gmail.com saying:
"Hey John, I think we might have left the documents on 221B Baker Street 
before our trip to Boston."

The message also mentioned a date, 12/05/2024, which immediately caught his eye. 
He checked his old calendar and found another note: “Dinner with Dr. Emily Clark 
on 5 Jan 2023.”  

Later that day, he called her at +1 202 555 0175 to confirm the meeting.  
She didn't answer, but sent him another email: emily.clark@univ.edu.  

Among his messy desk papers, John also found a business card that said:
"Mr. Robert Hayes, Financial Manager, 15 Wall Street, New York City. 
Call: (212) 555-0189. Card No: 4111 1111 1111 1111."

Somewhere in the chaos, there was a small sticky note that said:
"Meet with agent at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington DC, 2022-11-09."

Before leaving, he noticed another scrap of paper with strange numbers:
5500-0000-0000-0004 — maybe another card? Or just random digits?

He shrugged, grabbed his phone, and texted Emily: “Everything ready for tomorrow?”
